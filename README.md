# Calculator Drawing App

This project combines a simple calculator with a drawing app, allowing users to perform basic calculations and visually draw shapes or figures within the same interface. It is developed using Python and PyQt5, offering an interactive graphical user interface (GUI).
# Features

    Calculator: Supports basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
    Drawing Canvas: Users can freely draw shapes and figures on the canvas using a mouse.
    PyQt5 Integration: Utilizes PyQt5 to build an intuitive and interactive GUI for both the calculator and drawing features.
    Clear and Reset Options: Users can clear the canvas or reset the calculator input.
    Cross-Functionality: Both calculator and drawing tools can be used simultaneously without switching windows.
